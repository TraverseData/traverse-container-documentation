Overview
--------

To use the Traverse container, load it from the [resource URL](resource-url) and then call the [`start` method](start-method).

Resource URL
------------

The container is hosted at the following URL:

<a href="">http(s)://static.traversedlp.com/v1/container/traverse-container.js?clientId=`clientId`</a>

| Parameter    | Description | Required |
| ------------ |------------ | -------- |
| `clientId` | Your 36-character client ID (includes hyphens). | Yes |

`Start` method
--------------

Initialize the container by passing a [`user` object](#user-object) to the `start` method.

| Parameter    | Description | Required |
| ------------ |------------ | -------- |
| `user` | A [user](#user) object | Yes |

`User` object
-------------

A `user` object is written as a [Javascript Object Literal](http://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/object-literal/) and may contain any of the following fields:

| Parameter   | Description | Required |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `email`     | Plaintext (non-hashed) email address. The container handles all normalization and hashing.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Yes |

| `last`      | Last name. | No |
| `phone`     | Free-form telephone number. | No |

| `city`      | The city name.  | No |

| `waid`      | Microsoft's Windows Advertising ID.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | No |
| `uaid`      | Any unknown advertising ID. Use this value if you are uncertain which type you are receiving.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | No |
| `uaidHash`  | Use this if you meet the criteria above, your ID has been hashed, and you do not know which algorithm was used. | No |

<sub><b id="f1">1</b> Our container automatically handles the normalization and hashing of potentially sensitive fields. You may set these hashes manually using the following the naming convention: {parameter name}{hash type}{original character casing}. E.g. `emailMd5Upper`, `waidSha1Lower`, etc. If you choose to do this, we require both Md5 and Sha1 hashes for both upper and lower-case input values. [â†©](#a1)</sub>

Example
-------

Include our tag, and initialize with your user data:

```
<script src="http(s)://static.traversedlp.com/v1/container/traverse-container.js?clientId=YOUR-CLIENT-ID-HERE" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
TraverseContainer.start({
  email:     "john.doe@example.com",
  first:     "John",
  last:      "Doe",
  phone:     "123-456-6789",
  street1:   "123 Main St.",
  street2:   "Apartment 1A",
  city:      "Springfield",
  state:     "IL",
  zip:       "12345",
  context:   ["in-market car", "smoker"],
  userId:    "123abc"
});
</script>
```

Best practices
--------------

This module should always be loaded in the page body rather than head. For optimal page load, place script tag at the bottom of your page HTML.
