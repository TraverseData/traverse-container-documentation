| `city`      | The city name  | No |
| `state`     | The full U.S. state name or two-letter abbreviation | No |

  first:    "John",
  last:     "Doe",
  phone:    "123-456-6789",
  street1:   "123 Main St.",
  street2:  "Apartment 1A",
  city:     "Springfield",
  state:    "IL",
  zip:      "1234"
});
```

Example

Include our tag, and initialize with your client data

```
<script src="resourceURL" type="text/javascript"><script/>
<script type="text/javascript">
TraverseContainer.start({
   email: "jdoe@domain.com",
   first: "John",
   last: "Doe",
   state: "CO"
 });

</script>
```

Best Practices
--------------

This module should always be loaded in the page body rather than head. For optimal page load, place script tag at the bottom of your page HTML.
