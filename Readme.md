Example
-------

Include our tag, and initialize with your user data:

<script src="resourceURL" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
TraverseContainer.start({
   email: "jdoe@domain.com",
   first: "John",
   last: "Doe",
   state: "CO",
   audiences: ["in-market car", "smoker"],
   userId:    "123abc"
 });

</script>
```

Best Practices
--------------

This module should always be loaded in the page body rather than head. For optimal page load, place script tag at the bottom of your page HTML.
